                <h3>Cloud9 CSGO Wins ESL Pro League Season 4 in São Paulo!</h3>
                <p>
                    Cloud9 won its first ESL Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Pro League championship On the 30th of October,
                    defeating last season's defending champions SK Gaming 2-1. Despite SK Gaming's hometown advantage in
                    Brazil, North America's Cloud9 steamrolled through the squad in the Pro league Season 4 finals, taking
                    home $200,000 of the $600,000 prize pool. Cloud9 is the first North American team to win a big international
                    CS:GO tournament since Team SoloMid won the PGL Championship Series in October 2015. C9's Michael "Shroud"
                    Grzesiek and Jake "Stewie2" Yip led the team to an overwhelming victory along with newest member Timothy
                    "Autimatic" Ta, making play after play to upset SK. After a close loss in overtime to SK Gaming in the
                    first game, Cloud9 was absolutely unstoppable, taking the next two maps Mirage and Dust2 16-6 and 16-5
                    for a swift victory in São Paulo.

                <h3>Slemmy Steps Down; autimatic to Cloud9 CS:GO | Danan Flander | August 17, 2016</h3>
                <p>
                    Effective immediately, Alec "Slemmy" White has stepped down from the Cloud9 CS:GO starting roster. Following
                    our final ELeague Season 1 match against Na'Vi in late July, Alec communicated his wishes to the organization.
                    After thoroughly discussing options, Alec asked to be removed from the starting roster shortly before
                    the two week team break scheduled for early August. Following his decision, we approached a handful of
                    players and organizations to begin looking into finding his replacement. Throughout this scouting process,
                    Alec has echoed the sentiment that he currently has no intention of stepping into a coaching role, and
                    fully intends to continue his career as a player. We continued to speak with and trial players over the
                    course of the last three weeks, and, as of last night, we have agreed to terms with Team Solomid, facilitating
                    the transfer of Timothy "autimatic" Ta into the Cloud9 CS:GO family. Formerly of compLexity Gaming and
                    Team Solomid, Tim's introduction to the scene dates back to playing casual Counter-Strike: Source in
                    2009. Only in the spotlight for the last two years, Tim has shown tremendous growth as a player and we're
                    confident he will do the same as a teammate.
